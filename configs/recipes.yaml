# Custom pipeline recipes for DAPIDL.
#
# Each recipe is an ordered list of step names.
# Built-in recipes (default, gt, no_cl, annotate_only) are always available
# and cannot be overridden here.
#
# Custom recipes defined here are merged with built-ins.
#
# Available steps:
#   data_loader, ensemble_annotation, gt_annotation,
#   cl_standardization, lmdb_creation, segmentation
#
# Example:
#   gt_with_cl:
#     - data_loader
#     - gt_annotation
#     - cl_standardization
#     - lmdb_creation
#
#   segmented:
#     - data_loader
#     - segmentation
#     - ensemble_annotation
#     - lmdb_creation
